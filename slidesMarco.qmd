## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## DAG explanation

| Variable | Role | Explanation |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Patient_ID | Irrelevant | Unique identifier; no causal meaning. |
| Age | Confounder | Affects both tumor development and survival independently. |
| Gender | Confounder | Influences tumor biology and survival differences. |
| Tumor_Type | Mediator / Modifier | Affects tumor size and survival; downstream of genetic/biological causes. |
| Tumor_Size | Treatment | Exposure variable of interest. |
| Location | Confounder | Tumor location can affect growth and survival likelihood. |
| Histology | Confounder | Tumor cell type influences growth and prognosis. |
| Stage | Collider / Mediator | Influenced by size/symptoms; affects survival. |
| Symptom_1 / 2 / 3 | Collider / Proxy | Caused by tumor size; influences detection/treatment. |
| Radiation_Treatment | Mediator / Collider | Determined by size/stage; affects survival. |
| Surgery_Performed | Mediator / Collider | On the causal path; may also be affected by other factors. |
| Chemotherapy | Mediator / Collider | Same as above. |
| Survival_Rate | Outcome | Target variable. |
| Tumor_Growth_Rate | Mediator | Upstream of size; more aggressive tumors grow faster and affect survival. |
| Family_History | Confounder | Genetic risk; influences tumor characteristics and survival risk. |
| MRI_Result | Collider | Influenced by tumor/symptoms; affects treatment; don't adjust. |
| Follow_Up_Required | Collider | Based on tumor/treatment; conditioning may introduce bias. |

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("brain_tumor_dataset.csv")
summary(df)
str(df)

df <- df %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))

# Create list of unique symptoms
symptoms_list <- c("Headache", "Nausea", "Seizures", "Vision Issues")

# Initialize new binary columns with 0
for (symptom in symptoms_list) {
  df[[symptom]] <- 0
}

# Loop through Symptom_1 to Symptom_3 and update binary indicators
for (i in 1:3) {
  col_name <- paste0("Symptom_", i)
  for (symptom in symptoms_list) {
    df[[symptom]] <- df[[symptom]] | (df[[col_name]] == symptom)
  }
}

# Convert logicals to numeric (0/1)
df[symptoms_list] <- lapply(df[symptoms_list], as.integer)

# Drop the original Symptom_1 to Symptom_3 columns
df <- df[ , !(names(df) %in% c("Symptom_1", "Symptom_2", "Symptom_3"))]


str(df)
```

```{r}
library(mlr3verse)
library(DoubleML)

library(data.table)

df_dt <- as.data.table(df)

# Then create the DoubleMLData object
dml_data <- DoubleMLData$new(
  df_dt,
  y_col = "Survival_Rate",
  d_cols = "Tumor_Size",
  x_cols = c("Age","Gender","Location","Histology","Family_History")
)



# Learner for outcome and treatment model
ml_g <- lrn("regr.ranger")  # for outcome model
ml_m <- lrn("regr.ranger")  # for treatment model

# Initialize the DoubleMLPLR (Partially Linear Regression) model
dml_plr <- DoubleMLPLR$new(data = dml_data,
                           ml_g = ml_g,
                           ml_m = ml_m,
                           n_folds = 5)

# Fit the model
dml_plr$fit()

# Print summary
print(dml_plr$summary())
```
