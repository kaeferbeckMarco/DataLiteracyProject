## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## DAG explanation

| Variable | Role | Explanation |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Patient_ID | Irrelevant | Unique identifier; no causal meaning. |
| Age | Confounder | Affects both tumor development and survival independently. |
| Gender | Confounder | Influences tumor biology and survival differences. |
| Tumor_Type | Mediator / Modifier | Affects tumor size and survival; downstream of genetic/biological causes. |
| Tumor_Size | Treatment | Exposure variable of interest. |
| Location | Confounder | Tumor location can affect growth and survival likelihood. |
| Histology | Confounder | Tumor cell type influences growth and prognosis. |
| Stage | Collider / Mediator | Influenced by size/symptoms; affects survival. |
| Symptom_1 / 2 / 3 | Collider / Proxy | Caused by tumor size; influences detection/treatment. |
| Radiation_Treatment | Mediator / Collider | Determined by size/stage; affects survival. |
| Surgery_Performed | Mediator / Collider | On the causal path; may also be affected by other factors. |
| Chemotherapy | Mediator / Collider | Same as above. |
| Survival_Rate | Outcome | Target variable. |
| Tumor_Growth_Rate | Mediator | Upstream of size; more aggressive tumors grow faster and affect survival. |
| Family_History | Confounder | Genetic risk; influences tumor characteristics and survival risk. |
| MRI_Result | Collider | Influenced by tumor/symptoms; affects treatment; don't adjust. |
| Follow_Up_Required | Collider | Based on tumor/treatment; conditioning may introduce bias. |

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```
